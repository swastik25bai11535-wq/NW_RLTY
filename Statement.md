# Problem Statement

Many students and professionals struggle with managing daily tasks efficiently and often forget important activities or deadlines. Disorganized schedules lead to missed obligations and reduced productivity. There is a need for a simple digital tool to manage tasks and provide timely reminders to improve time management and task completion rates.

# Project Scope

This project aims to develop a console-based Reminder and To-Do List application with the following scope:

- Secure user authentication via password
- Time-based reminders for morning, afternoon, and evening tasks
- Management of a fixed list of tasks, tracking completion status
- Output of task progress and gentle encouragement on full completion
- Basic console interface without persistence or GUI in current version

Features like persistent task storage, user-specific task management, and graphical interfaces are excluded from this scope but proposed as future enhancements.

# Target Users

Students, freelancers, and professionals looking for a lightweight, easy-to-use tool to keep track of daily to-do items and receive automated reminders at key times of the day.

# High-Level Features

- Password-based user access control
- Notifications aligned to key time slots (6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM)
- To-Do list with add, update, and display completed/pending tasks functionality
- Feedback messages boosting user motivation upon task completion

This project provides a foundational framework for task and reminder management, suitable for expansion into a more robust productivity application.
